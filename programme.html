                            The MindLoops® Maker Space programme is an initiative launched by EDESS exclusively along with our partners geared towards primary school children. This annual programme is not just a mere programme, it also provides students with a comprehensive learning experience through the processes involved in the development of the prototypes as planned in this programme.
                        </p>
                        <br>
                        <p>
                            These experiences focus heavily on STEM and TVET subjects, while also nurturing entrepreneurial thinking skills within students and encouraging skills that are essential in the 21<sup>st</sup> century. This programme provides schools that are shortlisted by JPNJ with a platform with a platform to build a team of students to participate in the Maker Space competition.
                        </p>
                        <br>
                        <p>
                            Each team is given the task of choosing a theme and develop a conceptual prototype for a usable product. After the concept has been approved by the judges, the teams shall start develop the product within the given timeframe.
                        </p>
                        <br>
                        <p>
                            The final event of this programme will be the announcement of the winner among the 22 teams, and the award ceremony in which the team the shows their utmost effort and creativity in the development of their prototypes will be receiving medals (gold, silver, and bronze).
